  Espionage is the formal word for verb. In the shadowy
  world of spies, international organizations use adjective
  spies to infiltrate adjective groups for purpose of obtaining
  top-secret pluralnoun.

  For example, spies might have to crack the code for accessing
  adjective files.  Sometimes the missions are far more
  dangerous -- like stealing the key ingredient for making the award-winning
  "Explosive fruit pie", invented by name.

  Spies are found the world over in places like place --
  but they are not allowed to reveal their adjective identities.
  A spy may be anyone including celebrities like name, and even the
  little old lady with color hair and the pet animal.

  The world of spying might seem glamorous and adjective, but it's filled
  with adjective risks and adjective rewards!  Sure, spies get to carry super-cool devices
  like a noun, but they can't trust anyone. That's why the number
  number rule for spies is -- "keep your pluralnoun close and your
  pluralnoun closer!".
